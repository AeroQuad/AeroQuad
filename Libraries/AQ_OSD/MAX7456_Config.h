// The MAX7456 overlays characters in a grid 30 characters wide, 16/13 high
// (PAL/NTSC respectively). The row/column defines below correspond to
// positions in the grid of characters, with the origin at the top left.
// 0-origin indexing is used - ie row 0, col 0 is the highest, leftmost
// character on the screen while row 15, col 29 is the bottom right (for PAL).
//
// Generally avoid using the extreme border rows/columns as they are not
// always visible.
//
// Display elements start at the position you give and print to the right.
// They will wrap around to the next row if there are too few columns remaining
// on the row you specify.
