libmaple was previously very restricted to LeafLabs boards.  However,
the contents of libmaple proper are now fairly portable across medium-
and high-density STM32F1xx chips (though there are some caveats).  The
current design is expected to accomodate new chips straightforwardly
and well into the future.

The library's configuration is based around the files wirish/boards.h
(and .cpp), wirish/boards/*, and libmaple/stm32.h, as well as some
#defines it expects the environment to handle during compilation.

If you want to use libmaple proper, you must define one of
STM32_MEDIUM_DENSITY or STM32_HIGH_DENSITY during compilation.
Defining one of these allows libmaple to decide what processor
features to expose to you (e.g., definitions related to ADC3 aren't
compiled in when STM32_MEDIUM_DENSITY is defined).  There's no support
for low-density chips.  XL-density is planned but not done (we don't
have one to test on); patches (and samples) are welcome!  See:

    http://leaflabs.com/docs/libmaple/contributing.html

There are some other useful #defines the environment can provide when
compiling libmaple.  They aren't as crucial, though.  See the Makefile
for more information.

If you want to use Wirish, you'll need to define a BOARD_foo
(e.g. BOARD_maple, BOARD_maple_mini, etc.).  This determines which
board files get loaded from wirish/boards/.  See /wirish/boards.h and
/wirish/boards.cpp for more details.  See /wirish/boards/maple.h and
/wirish/boards/maple.cpp for well-commented examples on how to add a
new board configuration.

The code in libmaple/usb/ is not very portable at all right now;
expect this to change in the future.
